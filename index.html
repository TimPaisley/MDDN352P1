      		<h2>So what's all of this about, then?</h2>
      		<p class="lead">Glad you asked! Te Papa Culture Companion is a 'Web-based Companion App' for our Te Papa exhibits. In other words, it's a website that can accompany you on your smart phone, tablet, or laptop while you look around Te Papa, providing extra information, videos, audio snippets and additional material to complete your Te Papa experience. It can even make suggestions on what you might want to check out next!</p>

      		<h2>How does it work?</h2>
      		<p class="lead">Te Papa Culture Companion uses a range of different technologies to make it as easy as possible for you to get more information about each part of an exhibition. You'll find NFC tags, QR codes, and unique ID codes scattered around Te Papa which will take you to each different section of the web site.</p>

	          <p class="lead">NFC stands for Near-Field Communication, and it allows a small amount of data to be transferred between an NFC chip <i>(which you'll find scattered around each exhibit)</i> and a device <i>(such as a smart phone)</i>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NFC-enabled_mobile_devices" target="_blank">Click here</a> to check if your device is NFC compatible.</p>

	          <p class="lead">QR Codes are like barcodes for your phone. You can use applications on your phone to scan QR codes, each of which is unique and each of which will take you to a specified web address. If you can't use the NFC tags in our exhibits, scan the QR code instead!</p>

      		<h2>But why should you bother?</h2>
      		<p class="lead">Have you ever found a display in a museum that really gets you thinking? Something that interests you, something that you want to know more about? When we put together an exhibit, we selected some of the most important parts to show you, but there's so much more beneath the surface which we can't possibly fit! More stories, pictures, audio recordings and videos than you can sink your teeth into, and all in one easy-to-use online repository, ready at your fingertips for you to dive in.</p>

      		<h2>How can we make your experience more personal?</h2>
      		<p class="lead">When you decide to sign up for a Culture Companion account, one of the things that we recommend you do first is to take a short survey. The survey will ask you a few easy questions, such as how old you are and what you're interests are. This information will be used not only to help us make your experience better in the future, but also to curate your <i>Recommended</i> section - when you're ready to move onto something else, we can provide some handy suggestions on what we think you might like.</p>

	      			<p class="lead">Every time you tag onto a display article using NFC, QR codes or its unique ID, we'll give you some points! Your points will be kept on your account, and you'll be able to track your progress through our exhibits on your <i>Profile</i> page. Tag all displays in an exhibit to get 100% completion, then prove you're an expert on the topic by trying our exhibit quizzes to earn even more points!</p>

	      			<h2>What do the points do?</h2>
      				<p class="lead">We understand that kids can sometimes need a bit of persuation when it comes to learning, and with Culture Companion we award points for doing just that! Completing quizzes in each exhibit will unlock bonus digital content such as wallpapers and printable crafts. More points will score you small discounts in the gift store and for some exhibits, there may even be small goodie bags waiting in the gift shop for those who've done well.</p>
